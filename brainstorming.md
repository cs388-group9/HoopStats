        The size and scale differs depending on the topic of study or attending campus.
        Many students struggle to relate and to progress in their studies without people with similar experiences to learn from.
    Habit:
        StudyMate will include a thread regarding certain study topics and questions. This will attract students daily. This does not keep students subjected to simply relying on meeting with others either physically or virtually.
        The user will be able to create on the app. Whether it be creating new locations to meet, or new topics/threads to discuss.
    Scope:
        The scope is well-formed. It is focused specifically to students and their studies.
        The app should be quite straightforward to build; challenges may be encountered when dealing with precise locations and scheduling study appointments.
        The product is well-defined, but a stripped down version may be interesting due to the potential there is for creativity.
